I study 20th and 21st century African history with a focus on environment, History, Decolonialing Methodology, Slavery and Abolition, Taxation, Gender,  and Indigenous knowledge system. 

I am particulary interest in exploring how everyday activities like farming, mining, walking, fighting...shape place-making. The material components of the environment tells a narrative that is taken for granted, for example-  What can a footpath, floodmark, or grave stone tell us about a place? By tracing these environmental imprints, I ask how historians might better read landscapes as living archives.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of History at Indiana University Bloomington.  I hold a bachelor’s and master’s degree in history from the University of Ibadan and have received prestigious fellowships and grants, including the Roy Sieber African Studies Conference Travel Fellowship, the Robert H. Ferrell & Eric Sandweiss Fellowship, and the CRRES Graduate Student Research Grant.
